## Chapter 5: Nearest Neighbor Methods  

This chapter will focus on nearest neighbor methods and how to implement them in TensorFlow.

* Working with Nearest Neighbor  

We will use the Boston housing datasets and be predicting the median neighborhood housing value as a function of several features. We will find the k-NNs to the prediction points and do a weightd average of the target value.

Here is the histogram of predicted and actual values:
